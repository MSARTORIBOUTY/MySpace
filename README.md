Here you will find the functional model of the MySpace application.

But what is MySpace?

MySpace is an application whose purpose is to offer a personal space where the user can access his space, his settings but also his gallery!

We want the user to find in MySpace, an intuitive application where he will feel at home.

We are looking far ahead, and are already developing the next features in order to create the space we are talking about here: MySpace.

This application follows strict rules such as naming rules, outsourcing of strings and versions of dependencies.
